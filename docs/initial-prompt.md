# ClawChat

Mobile-first chat webapp for async communication with an AI agent.

## Core Concept

A single server hosts both the AI agent and the chat interface. Users access via browser on any device. The AI can notify users asynchronously through push notifications - no need to keep the app open.

## Key Features

- **Push notifications**: AI initiates contact when it has updates or needs input
- **Mobile-first**: Designed for phone browsers, works everywhere
- **Single server**: Agent and chat system co-located for simplicity
- **Async workflow**: Conversations persist; either party can respond anytime
